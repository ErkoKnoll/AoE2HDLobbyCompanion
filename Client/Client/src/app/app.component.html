                            <div style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px;">AoE 2 HD Lobby Companion uses <span class="clickable" (click)="openNethook()">NetHook2</span> to inject a DLL into Steam's address space in order to read its network traffic. While there aren't any known cases when Valve has banned for such activity then it is not warranted that they will not start taking preventative actions against users who are doing so by banning their accounts.</div>
                            <div style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px;">Most likely your account should remain intact since <span class="clickable" (click)="openVac()">AoE 2 HD is not a VAC protected game</span> nor is the software considered malicious. However it is highly recommended to close this software while playing other Steam games.</div>
                            <div style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px;">Some parts of the software such as Backend.exe and NetHook2.dll could be flagged as viruses by Anti-Virus software due to the nature of the work they have to perform, however they are merely false positives. More about NetHook2.dll in later step but Backend.exe is just a .NET web server that is spawned by the main client to perform more powerful tasks that the main client cannot do itself such as projecting an overlay.</div>
